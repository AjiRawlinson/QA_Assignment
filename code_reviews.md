# Code Reviews 

**Build and Test**  
 Prior to opening the Pull Request, it is important to ensure that the task being worked on works as expected and has not lead to any regression.

***Guidelines***
- Generate package using recommended way.
- Run all unit tests and integration tests - must be all passing prior pull request.

**Limit review session**  
A study has shown that reviewing faster than 400 line of code per hour results in a severe drop-off in effectiveness.   
A code review session should not last more than 60 minutes.
Take a break and come back to it later with fresh eyes.

**Constructive feedback**  
Giving feedback is very useful. On one hand, it helps ensuring every member of the team follows the team's coding standards. It also helps team member sharing knowledge and improving their skills. The following guidelines will help reviewers giving useful feedbacks during their reviews.

***Guidelines***  
- Give constructive feedbacks, rather than critical ones.
- Avoid comments that do not add any value or that are purely opinion-based.
- Provide some links to illustrate your comments.


***Example***  
Bad:  
*"Why didn’t you just do ___ here?”*

Good:   
*"You can do ___, which has the benefit of ____."*

**Include everyone**  
It is important to include everyone in the code review process. It helps every member being comfortable with the process itself. For junior developers, it is an excellent opportunity to learn.
