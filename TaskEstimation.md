# Task Estimation

In basic terms task estimation in the process in which a team works out roughly how long a project will take. Although, it is quite a complex task, it is vital that any project being undertaken has some form of task estimation in order to keep a project on the right track and within certain timeframes. A lack of good task estimation leads to a number of issues, such as projects running over or running under time, or an unnecessary amount of recourses being put into a project, possibly costing the company money and time. Using these guidelines can help to better estimate tasks and alleviate these possible issues.

## 1. Break Up Big Tasks:

This is the most fundamental element of task estimation. In this step you will take the most general tasks required in the project and drill down, creating a list of more detailed sub-tasks. This can help to extract more detail in terms of required work.

*	Create a list of the general tasks that are required for the project.
*	Take each of those tasks, and create a list of sub-tasks with in each general task
*	Consult with subject matter experts to better understand the duration of each task
*	Assign rough timeframes to each sub-task.
*	Allow for extra time to handle delays or other issues
*	Use a work breakdown structure (WBS)
*	Use similar, previous projects for a point of reference


## 2.	Estimate Resources

Every teams works differently with different strengths and weaknesses, which means it is vital that before estimating tasks, you speak with your team and understand where their strengths and weaknesses lay. 
*	Create a list of required resources.
*	Meet with team members to discuss what tasks are involved.
*	Work out any required learning that might need to be carried out.
*	Group team members to tasks based on their ability
