# Task Estimation

## Break Up Big Tasks:

This is the most fundamental element of task estimation. In this step you will take the most general tasks required in the project and drill down, creating a list of more detailed sub-tasks. This can help to extract more detail in terms of required work. To aid in breaking up these general tasks, use the top-down method.

***Guidelines***

*	Create a list of the general tasks that are required for the project.
*	Take each of those tasks, and create a list of sub-tasks with in each general task
*	Consult with subject matter experts to better understand the duration of each task
*	Assign rough timeframes to each sub-task.
*	Allow for extra time to handle delays or other issues
*	Use a work breakdown structure (WBS)
*	Use similar, previous projects for a point of reference

***Examples***

Bad:

Using a short list of general and vague tasks as the guideline for required work.

Good:

Create a short list of general tasks, within each general task, create another list of smaller tasks and use that as your team's work guideline.




##	Estimate Resources

Every teams works differently with different strengths and weaknesses, which means it is vital that before estimating tasks, you speak with your team and understand where their strengths and weaknesses lay. 
*	Create a list of required resources.
*	Meet with team members to discuss the tasks are involved.
*	Assign team members to tasks based on their ability

Bad:

Assign members to a task who do not have much technical knowlege of the task, leading to longer development time in order to include learning.

Good:

Meet with team members and discuss what their strengths and weaknesses are and assign them to tasks based on those strengths.
